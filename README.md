## Project 2 - Do Masks Really Work? A Look into COVID-19 and Influenza Deaths and Activity Level
When I worked as a lab assistant for a hospital's microbiology lab, my coworkers and I would ask if masked worked.
To answer that question, I gathered data from the CDC's website and used a timeline to analysis the trends of COVID deaths and Influenza cases.

## Project 3 - There’s Something Going In Everyone’s Head: An Analysis on Various Mental Disorders Across the World
The talk about mental disorders have been on the rise lately, especially with major topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, politics, economies, etc.
I wanted to see where each country stands in terms of mental disorders. I gathered some datasets from various health websites and compared each countries'
numbers to each other. I then displayed the top 10 countries per mental disorder in Tableau using line graphs.
